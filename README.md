Myth #3 Masturbation can make you lose your virginity<br>

Fact: NO! Firstly, let's understand that virginity is a social construct. It is not something physical or medical. Concepts like virginity are inked with the idea that your vagina is covered by a membrane that is broken y vaginal sex. To ‘preserve’ virginity, many parents also do not allow their female children to use tampons or cups.  The truth is that regardless of whether you masturbate or not, this membrane called the hymen will wear over time. <br>

Myth #4 Masturbation is a male activity<br>

Fact: If you consume a lot of pop culture, you might also believe in this myth. But we have some news for you: Women also masturbate. Unfortunately, what we see in popular movies, music, and T.V. shows women’s sexuality only in the service of men. However, women also masturbate, and so do trans and gender non-conforming folks. <br>

Myth #5 Masturbation kills your sex drive<br>

Fact: Masturbation does not kill your sex drive; it does the opposite: it increases the chances of having more satisfying sex. This is because solo play allows you to explore your body and discover what gives you pleasure. Amongst women, masturbation is a way to discover clit-stimulation; an organ that has been widely ignored. <br>

Myth #6 Masturbation can cause blindness<br>

Fact: Please do not listen to this. This myth dates back to centuries when the only purpose of sex was thought to be procreation. Since masturbation is not for procreating, it was thought to be taboo and branded as problematic. Thus came such beliefs that masturbation causes diseases like tuberculosis, hairy palms, insanity and death. Obviously, all of these are false. <br>

Myth #7 Masturbation should be done alone<br>

Fact: Mutual consensual masturbation is a thing. You can try it out with your partner. Whether you want to spice up your sex life or simply explore a new terrain together: masturbating with your partner will help you understand your and each other's sexual needs. <br>

Myth #8 Excessive masturbation can lead to erectile dysfunction <br>

Fact: Erectile dysfunction does not happen due to masturbation. What can happen is that you get used to a certain touch and sensation, so when engaging in sex with another individual, you can find it difficult to have an orgasm. <br>

Myth #9 Masturbation has no benefits<br>

Fact: This is another point that comes when talking about the benefits and side effects of masturbation. However, there are benefits to orgasm other than feeling pleasure. <br>
As mentioned above, masturbation can help in releasing stress. Apart from this, it also helps in releasing menstrual cramps and easing muscle tension. Orgasm also releases dopamine- which helps you sleep better. <br>

So, there you have it- some of the most common myths and facts about masturbation. It is okay to masturbate every day or never do it! Make sure to choose what is best for your body and what feels good to you, rather than fixating on what others think or the myths about what masturbation can do to your body.<br>
